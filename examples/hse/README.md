# HSE example

This is an end-to-end worked example of taking quite message data from a partial scrap of the HSE web site and progressively converting it to cleaner and clearer RDF.

* `hse.json` - the source data in original raw form (jsonlines format)
* `testhse.json` - small sample of hse.json for test purposes
* `run` - example templates for the HSE data
